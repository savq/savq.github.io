title = "Computer Science Books"

These are books that I've had to read at some point for my coursework, and
self-study. Most are _reference_ books, and I don't think I've read even a
tenth of some.

This list isn't comprehensive nor authoritative. I'm a student, and these are
books I would recommend to fellow students. There are plenty of similar lists
online, so I guess it's main advantage is that it isn't so long.


## Mathematics
- Hammack, _Book of Proof_
  - [Available online](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)
  - Good introductory book. Lighter introduction to the topics covered in Bloch (below).
- Bloch, _Proof and Fundamentals_
  - Good reference book for basic logic, proofs, set theory, etc.
  - Part III covers "pretty" topics: groups, lattices, etc.
- Axler, _Linear Algebra Done Right_
  - I did my first course on Linear Algebra following my professor's notes, and
    I've used this book to go back and review the subject. Not sure if it's a
    good _introductory_ book.


## Algorithms and Data structures
- Skiena. _Algorithm Design Manual_
  - Currently working through this one!
- Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, _Introduction to Algorithms_ (CLRS)
  - Good reference book. Still, I would've liked if someone had
    shown me a lighter book before (like Skiena above).


## Information Theory and Intelligent Systems
- MacKay, _Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms_
  - I've read bits and pieces for different courses. _Very interesting._
- Russell and Norvig, _Artificial intelligence: a modern approach_
  - Good reference book.


## Operating Systems
- Arpaci-Dusseau and Arpaci-Dusseau, _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_
  - [Available online](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  - Good book.
- Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne, _Operating Systems Concepts_ (dinosaur book)
  - Reference book.
- Kernighan and Ritchie, _The C Programming Language_
  - No point in trying to learn C anywhere else. This is it.
- _Beej's Guide to Network Programming_
  - [Available online](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
  - Fun and easy to read.


## Computer architecture
- Patterson and Hennessy, _Computer Organization and Design - RISC-V Edition_
  - _Great book._ I think it's the only one on the list that I've read on my free time.
- Nisan and Schocken, _Elements of Computing Systems_ (nand2tetris)
  - Only the first part is focused on computer architecture.
  - It feels a bit artificial, but it's still really useful.


## Canonical papers
We stand on the shoulders of giants.

- A. M. Turing. _On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem_
- C. E. Shannon. _A Mathematical Theory of Communication_
- E. F. Codd. _A relational model for large shared data banks_
- J. McCarthy. _Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and their computation by Machine_
