title = "CS reference books"
+++

These are books that I've had to read at some point for my coursework,
and self-study. Most are _reference_ books, and I don't think I've read
even a tenth of some.

This isn't an authoritative list by any means. I'm a student, and these are
books I would recommend to fellow students.  There are plenty of similar lists
online, so I guess the only advantage this one has is that it isn't so god damn
long.

TODO: move this to a commented `.bib` file instead?


## Mathematics
- Bloch. Proof and Fundamentals
  - Good reference book for basic logic, proofs, set theory etc.
  - Part III covers "pretty" topics: groups, lattices, etc.
- Hammack. Book of Proof
  - [Available online](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)
  - Good introductory book. Lighter introduction to the topics covered in Bloch part I and II
- Axler. Linear Algebra Done Right
  - I did my first course on linear algebra following my professor's notes,
    so I've used Axler's as a book to go back and review
    the subject. Not sure if it's a good _introductory_ book.
- DeGroot. Probability and Statistics
  - My probability professor was kind of obsessed with this oneâ€¦



## Information Theory and Intelligent Systems
- Mackay. Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms
  - I've read bits and pieces for different courses. _Very_ interesting 
- Russell, Norvig. Artificial Intelligence
  - Good reference book


## Algorithms and Data structures
- Skiena. Algorithm Design Manual
  - Currently working through this one!
- Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
  - Good reference book. Still, I would've liked if someone had
    shown me a lighter book (see Skiena) before



## Operating Systems
- Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne. Operating Systems Concepts (dinosaur book)
  - Reference book
- Arpaci, Dusseau. Operating Systems three_easy_pieces
  - [Available online](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  - Good book
- Kernighan, Ritchie. The C programming language
  - No point in trying to learn C anywhere else. This book is it.
- Beej's Guide to Network Programming
  - [Available online](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
  - Good to-the-point book

## Computer architecture
- Nisan, Schocken. Elements of Computing systems (nand2tetris)
  - It feels a bit artificial at times
- Patterson, Hennessy. Computer Organization and Design - RISC-V Edition
  - _Great book._ I think it's the only one on the list that I've read on my free time

## Canonical papers
We stand on the shoulders of giants.


- A. M. Turing. On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem
- C. E. Shannon. Mathematical Theory of Communication
- E. F. Codd. Relational Model of Data
- J. McCarthy. Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and their computation by Machine
