title = "CS reference books"
+++

These are books that I've had to read at some point for my coursework,
and self-study. Most are _reference_ books, and I don't think I've read
even a tenth of some.

This isn't an authoritative list by any means. I'm a student, and these are
books I would recommend to fellow students.  There are plenty of similar lists
online, so I guess the only advantage this one has is that it isn't so god damn
long.

TODO: move this to a commented `.bib` file instead?


## Mathematics
- Hammack. _Book of Proof_
  - [Available online](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/)
  - Good introductory book. Lighter introduction to the topics covered in Bloch part I and II
- Bloch. _Proof and Fundamentals_
  - Good reference book for basic logic, proofs, set theory etc.
  - Part III covers "pretty" topics: groups, lattices, etc.
- Axler. _Linear Algebra Done Right_
  - I did my first course on linear algebra following my professor's notes,
    so I've used Axler's as a book to go back and review
    the subject. Not sure if it's a good _introductory_ book.
- DeGroot. _Probability and Statistics_
  - My probability professor was kind of obsessed with this oneâ€¦


## Information Theory and Intelligent Systems
- MacKay. _Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms_
  - I've read bits and pieces for different courses. _Very_ interesting 
- Russell, Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence_
  - Good reference book


## Algorithms and Data structures
- Skiena. _Algorithm Design Manual_
  - Currently working through this one!
- Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. _Introduction to Algorithms_ (CLRS)
  - Good reference book. Still, I would've liked if someone had
    shown me a lighter book (see Skiena) before


## Operating Systems
- Arpaci, Dusseau. _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_
  - [Available online](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  - Good book
- Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne. _Operating Systems Concepts_ (dinosaur book)
  - Reference book
- Kernighan, Ritchie. _The C Programming Language_
  - No point in trying to learn C anywhere else. This book is it.
- _Beej's Guide to Network Programming_
  - [Available online](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)
  - Good to-the-point book


## Computer architecture
- Nisan, Schocken. _Elements of Computing Systems_ (nand2tetris)
  - It feels a bit artificial at times
- Patterson, Hennessy. _Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface - RISC-V Edition_
  - _Great book._ I think it's the only one on the list that I've read on my free time

## Canonical papers
We stand on the shoulders of giants.

- A. M. Turing. _On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem_
- C. E. Shannon. _A Mathematical Theory of Communication_
- E. F. Codd. _A relational model for large shared data banks_
